	abstract = {The matter in extreme conditions end station at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a new tool enabling accurate pump–probe measurements for studying the physical properties of matter in the high-energy density (HED) physics regime. This instrument combines the world’s brightest x-ray source, the LCLS x-ray beam, with high-power lasers consisting of two nanosecond Nd:glass laser beams and one short-pulse Ti:sapphire laser. These lasers produce short-lived states of matter with high pressures, high temperatures or high densities with properties that are important for applications in nuclear fusion research, laboratory astrophysics and the development of intense radiation sources. In the first experiments, we have performed highly accurate x-ray diffraction and x-ray Thomson scattering measurements on shock-compressed matter resolving the transition from compressed solid matter to a co-existence regime and into the warm dense matter state. These complex charged-particle systems are dominated by strong correlations and quantum effects. They exist in planetary interiors and laboratory experiments, e.g., during high-power laser interactions with solids or the compression phase of inertial confinement fusion implosions. Applying record peak brightness x-rays resolves the ionic interactions at atomic (Ångstrom) scale lengths and measure the static structure factor, which is a key quantity for determining equation of state data and important transport coefficients. Simultaneously, spectrally resolved measurements of plasmon features provide dynamic structure factor information that yield temperature and density with unprecedented precision at micron-scale resolution in dynamic compression experiments. These studies have demonstrated our ability to measure fundamental thermodynamic properties that determine the state of matter in the HED physics regime.}

abstract = "Motivated by the current high interest in the field of warm dense matter research, in this article we review the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature and over a broad density range relevant for warm dense matter applications. We provide an exhaustive overview of different simulation techniques, focusing on recent developments in the dielectric formalism (linear response theory) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Our primary focus is on two novel QMC methods that have recently allowed us to achieve breakthroughs in the thermodynamics of the warm dense electron gas: Permutation blocking path integral MC (PB-PIMC) and configuration path integral MC (CPIMC). In fact, a combination of PB-PIMC and CPIMC has allowed for a highly accurate description of the warm dense UEG over a broad density–temperature range. We are able to effectively avoid the notorious fermion sign problem, without invoking uncontrolled approximations such as the fixed node approximation. Furthermore, a new finite-size correction scheme is presented that makes it possible to treat the UEG in the thermodynamic limit without loss of accuracy. In addition, we in detail discuss the construction of a parametrization of the exchange–correlation free energy, on the basis of these data — the central thermodynamic quantity that provides a complete description of the UEG and is of crucial importance as input for the simulation of real warm dense matter applications, e.g., via thermal density functional theory. A second major aspect of this review is the use of our \textit{ab initio} simulation results to test previous theories, including restricted PIMC, finite-temperature Green functions, the classical mapping by Perrot and Dharma-wardana, and various dielectric methods such as the random phase approximation, or the Singwi–Tosi–Land–Sjölander (both in the static and quantum versions), Vashishta–Singwi and the recent Tanaka scheme for the local field correction. Thus, for the first time, thorough benchmarks of the accuracy of important approximation schemes regarding various quantities such as different energies, in particular the exchange–correlation free energy, and the static structure factor, are possible. In the final part of this paper, we outline a way how to rigorously extend our QMC studies to the inhomogeneous electron gas. We present first \textit{ab initio} data for the static density response and for the static local field correction.",
