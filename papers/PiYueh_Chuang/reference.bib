The {GELU} activation function is \${xΦ}(x)\$, where \$Φ(x)\$ the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function. The {GELU} nonlinearity weights inputs by their value, rather than gates inputs by their sign as in {ReLUs} (\$x{\textbackslash}mathbf\{1\}\_\{x\&gt;0\}\$). We perform an empirical evaluation of the {GELU} nonlinearity against the {ReLU} and {ELU} activations and find performance improvements across all considered computer vision, natural language processing, and speech tasks.},
