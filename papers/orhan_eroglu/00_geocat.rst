The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: An Open Development, Community Driven Toolkit in the Scientific Python Ecosystem
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team develops and maintains
data analysis and visualization tools on structured and unstructured grids for
the geosciences community in the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE). In response to
dealing with increasing geoscientific data sizes, GeoCAT prioritizes scalability,
ensuring its implementations are scalable from personal laptops to HPC clusters.
Another major goal of the GeoCAT team is to ensure community involvement throughout
the whole project lifecycle, which is realized through an open development mindset
by encouraging users and contributors to get involved in decision-making.

Introduction
------------

The Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team, established in 2019,
leads the software engineering efforts of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) “Pivot to Python” initiative :cite:`pivot19`. Before then,
NCAR Command Language (NCL) :cite:`ncl` was developed by NCAR as an interpreted,
domain-specific language that was aimed to support the analysis and
visualization needs of the global geosciences community. NCL had been serving
several tens of thousands of users for decades. It is still available for use
but has not been actively developed as it has been in maintenance mode.
